# NLP-Final-Project
CSCI-SHU 376 Natural Language Processing | Spring 2021 | Final Project

"The purpose of the final project is two-fold. First, it will give you the opportunity and incentive to study in-depth a topic that interests you. Second, it will test your ability to use NLP algorithms to solve a problem within this topic. The project definition is purposefully open- ended. The goal is for you to be able to spend time thinking deeply about NLP and how to best apply it in a real-life scenario."
